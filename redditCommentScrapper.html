I started this project because I found reddit's api fairly lacking in terms of getting commments from posts. 
<br><br>
The tool uses jq and was made for mac os. once you have the executable and have added it to your path you can run it via redditCommentScrapper (post URL). Or you can pipe multiple URLs into it as well.
<br>
The results are printed to standard output which can be redirected into their own file.

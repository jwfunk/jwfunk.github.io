This is a project that was based off the concept of Neural Networks. The main difference is instead of the nodes being represented as weights that define an equation, this network simulates Neurons and the charges that propagate through them. The Network starts off with a set of Neurons that represent inputs and outputs. The input Neurons fire when a condition is satisfied. The "decision" of the Network is given when an output Neuron is fired.
<br><br>
The individual neurons consist of four things. The neuron's current charge, critical charge, pulse value, and its receiving neurons. The initial value of all current charges in the network is 0. Once a neuron's current charge reaches or exceeds its critical charge it will pulse its receivers and decrease its current charge by the value of its critical charge. Any neurons that are pulsed will have their current charge increased by the value of the pulse. 
<br><br>
The goal is to start with a untrained network and apply mutations to it gradually so that it performs better at a given task. To accomplish this, the user needs to define the initial untrained network, how the network is allowed to mutate, as well as how the fitness of the network is evaluated.
<br><br>
My first use of this framework was to train a network to play Tic Tac Toe. Below you can play against an AI that has been trained using this framework

<nav class="navr">The AI making moves in this is run by an aws Lambda function that has the Network's moves uploaded to it. This was done just to experiment with Lambda functions and API calls.</nav>

The network starts off in a default state, in this case with 10 input neurons and 9 output neurons plus 10 additional neurons that resemble the start of each possible move for the game tree. Additionally, there are 10 other neurons that prevent charges from propagating down other paths once the initial one is started. The mutations the initial mutations that this network will go through is linking those additional 10 neurons to a single output neuron. Subsequent mutations will add new neurons that will link with one input neuron and another one representing a state of the game such as one of the additional 10. These new ones will link to an output effectively creating a game tree that will take one path as the charges propagate. The networks are evaluated by playing against all the possible moves against them. Any move the network is able to make adds a point to their score. If a move the network makes ends up winning the game the score is increased by a value that's greater than if the network were to always tie with every other path. If the network moves in a way that makes it prone to losing its score will end up as 0.

<article class="picr">Note that this diagram does not include all of the connections for the default network. All of the left white nodes would be connected to all of the right white nodes except their respective counterpart like the top one is. These were omitted in order to keep the diagram visually appealing.</article>

Each of the green neurons represents a condition that the network will respond to. When asked to respond to an empty board, the first neuron fires. If the opponent takes the top left position, the second neuron fires. Each position has its own corresponding input neuron. If the first output neuron fires, the network has chosen the top left position on the board. This is identical to the inputs setup except the outputs have no need for an empty output. Logically that would forgo a turn which would never be advantageous.

In principle, you could train one of these networks to accomplish any task if you provide the correct mutations and evaluation of what makes a network better. The main issue I've come across is the amount of time needed for these tasks. For example, you could do the same thing I've done for chess but immediately you would notice that going through all the possible moves would take an extreme amount of time. It was only practical in my case because Tic Tac Toe doesn't have many possible moves. Even so, my network took about 3 hours to get to a point where it could play perfectly meaning that it would never lose or forgo a turn. Creating an effective way to mutate the network was also a challenge. One could simply apply random mutations with no structure and expect a capable network to emerge. That is in essence the power of natural selection. When doing this I found that random mutations simply take too much time to get to any point that is useful. I carefully planned out a way so the network would be more likely to make potentially beneficial mutations which saw far greater results. 
<br><br>
The challenge is then to define mutations in a way that they will be likely to benefit the fitness of the network and to figure out how to evaluate a network's efficiency in in a timely manner.

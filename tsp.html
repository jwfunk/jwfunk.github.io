I have been contemplating possible ways to solve the TSP for a couple years now. This is my latest attempt. If I find that it is actually an effective tool I will explain it's process in more depth but this remains to be seen.

Currently it can find the solution to problems where n is around 50. I have it running on a problem where n is 194 and am waiting for the results which could take upwords of a month. If those are promissing I will optimize this more and introduce multithreading.
